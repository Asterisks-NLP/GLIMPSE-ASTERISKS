# GLIMPSE-ASTERISKS
This repository is dedicated to GLIMPSE Summarization Project for Deep Natural Language Processing (01VIXSM) 2024/25.

# GLIMPSE
GLIMPSE is a summarization method designed to extract both common and unique viewpoints from multiple peer reviews using a Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework. It enhances transparency and decision-making in academic review processes by balancing informativeness and distinctiveness in generated summaries.

# How To RUN

In order to run the whole code we strongly suggest that you use Google Colab with Colab Pro subscription. Otherwise you might face VRAM insufficiency error.

- To Generate Abstractive and Extractive Candidates and Compute RSA Open __GLIMPSE_ASTERISKS.ipynb__ and run the cells in order (Highly Resource Intensive: Use Colab)

- To compute ROUGE Scores and extract comptued RSA Scores run all the cells in __Scoring.ipynb__ file. (Low Resource Intensivity)

- To plot the score graphs and generate score tables, run all the cells in __Plots_Tables.ipynb__ file. (Low Resource Intensivity)
